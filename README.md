## Maggie Winter Data Science Portfolio

> #### This repository will include projects completed during the spring of 2025, including those done as part of the "Intro to Data Science" class at Notre Dame. 

### Projects :card_index_dividers:
[Onward to Victory](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/153f4808ed3f8139c046347ccebe37aa52d73870/basic_streamlit_app) : A streamlit app that explores the characteristics of college football fight songs; users can navigate via specific variables, schools, and conferences.

[Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) : A Jupyter Notebook that cleans a dataset of Summer 2008 Olympic medalists according to tidy data principles. This builds on *Onward to Victory* by featuring data cleaning alongside data visualization. 

[K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning App](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) : A streamlit app uploaded to the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://knnmachinelearningapp.streamlit.app). It allows the user to upload their own data and specify parameters of a KNN model, advancing understanding of supervised machine learning applications. This app builds on previous projects by incorporating interactivity with data management and visualization.

[K-Means Unsupervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp) : A streamlit app also uploaded to the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://winter-data-science-portfolio-unsupervised-kmeans.streamlit.app). Users can upload their own data or use a provided wine quality dataset, process the data, choose the number of clusters, and view elbow and slihouette score plots. This stands in contrast to the previous app, clarifying supervised vs. unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
