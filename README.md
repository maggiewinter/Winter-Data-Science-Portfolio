## Maggie Winter Data Science Portfolio

> #### This repository will include projects completed during the spring of 2025, including those done as part of the "Intro to Data Science" class at Notre Dame. 

### Projects :card_index_dividers:
[Onward to Victory](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/153f4808ed3f8139c046347ccebe37aa52d73870/basic_streamlit_app) : A streamlit app that explores the characteristics of college football fight songs; users can navigate via specific variables, schools, and conferences.

[Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) : A Jupyter Notebook that cleans a dataset of Summer 2008 Olympic medalists according to tidy data principles. This builds on *Onward to Victory* by featuring data cleaning alongside data visualization. 

[K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning App](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) : A streamlit app uploaded to the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://knnmachinelearningapp.streamlit.app). It allows the user to upload their own data and specify parameters of a KNN model, advancing understanding of supervised machine learning applications. This app builds on previous projects by incorporating interactivity with data management and visualization.
