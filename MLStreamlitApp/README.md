> ### K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning App :chart_with_upwards_trend:

This app allows users to experiment with different distance metrics and k values in a k-nearest neighbors classifier. Users may upload their own csv file in a clean format or use the [`california_housing.csv`](https://github.com/akmand/datasets/blob/main/california_housing.csv) file built in to the app. The goal of the app is to break down the components of a KNN model in an adjustable and understandable way. Within the file is the option to generate a line graph of accuracy values for each k value (up to a user-selected maximum)- for each of three distance metrics.

*To run the app, enter `streamlit run Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/MLStreamlitApp/main.py`* 

OR *view it on Streamlit Community Cloud at [this link](https://knnmachinelearningapp.streamlit.app)*
