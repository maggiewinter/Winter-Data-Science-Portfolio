> ### K-Means Unsupervised Machine Learning App :green_book:

This app builds on the previous [K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning App](https://github.com/maggiewinter/Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp). Users can use the provided `winequality-red` dataset or upload their own into a K-Means clustering algorithm. The PCA plot is then visualized by cluster and by true label, if one is specified. Elbow and silhouette score plots are displayed to aid in the cluster amount selection. 

*To run the app, enter `streamlit run Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/MLUnsupervisedApp/main.py`* 

OR *view it on Streamlit Community Cloud at [this link]([https://knnmachinelearningapp.streamlit.app](https://winter-data-science-portfolio-unsupervised-kmeans.streamlit.app))*
