> ### Onward to Victory: A streamlit app to dive into the world of college fight songs :musical_note: :football:

This app is based on the file `fight_songs.csv` from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/fight-songs/README.md), which compiled data about the history and lyrics of 65 fight songs from the Power Five conferences (plus Notre Dame). Users can view overall summary visualizations, filter the songs by specific variables, and learn more about the fight songs of chosen schools and conferences.

*To run the app, enter `streamlit run Winter-Data-Science-Portfolio/basic_streamlit_app/main.py`*
